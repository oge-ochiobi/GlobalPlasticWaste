# üåç EcoGuard Alliance - Global Plastic Waste Analysis (2023)  

## **Project Overview**  
EcoGuard Alliance is a research-driven initiative aimed at analyzing global plastic waste generation, management, and its environmental impact. By leveraging data analytics, visualization tools, and predictive models, this project provides actionable insights to drive policy-making, sustainability efforts, and corporate responsibility initiatives.  

## **Key Objectives**  
- Analyze plastic waste production and distribution across 165 countries.  
- Identify key contributors to plastic pollution.  
- Examine waste management techniques such as recycling, landfilling, and incineration.  
- Explore the correlation between recycling rates and environmental risk.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations to mitigate plastic pollution.  

## **Data Sources**  
- **Global Waste Database 2023** (aggregated data from research institutions -  Kaggle).  
- **World Bank & UN Reports** (waste management policies & statistics).    
- **National Waste Agencies** (country-specific waste reports).  

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- GIS Mapping for geospatial plastic waste tracking  
- Predictive Analytics (Regression models & Forecasting)

## **Key Findings & Recommendations**  
1. **Waste Generation Disparities** ‚Äì A small number of countries produce the majority of plastic waste.  
2. **Primary Waste Sources** ‚Äì Varying waste sources highlight the need for country-specific interventions.  
3. **Recycling & Waste Risk Correlation** ‚Äì Countries with higher coastal waste risk must enhance recycling efforts.  
4. **Success Models** ‚Äì Japan & Singapore serve as examples of effective plastic waste management strategies.  

## **Conclusion**  
A sustainable future requires data-driven interventions and collaborative efforts between governments, corporations, and individuals. By improving recycling infrastructure, enforcing policy regulations, and adopting innovative waste management technologies, we can significantly reduce global plastic pollution.
